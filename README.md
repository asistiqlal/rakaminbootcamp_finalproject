# Final Project for Data Science Bootcamp on Rakamin Academy

This project was done on October 2021 using Google Collab by 5 people including me where I also acted as the leader of the team.

The data we used in this project was retrieved from Kaggle (get it here: https://bit.ly/3vX8GMw).

Each member played an active role and always gave their perspectives in inputs for every stages in this project, but the focus of each member varied based on the division of work as follows:
- Data preprocessing by A Salsabila Istiqlal
- EDA by Annette Michelle & Onang Surya Nugroho
- Modeling by A Salsabila Istiqlal & Muhammad Reza Rivaldi
- Group report & presentation slide by Subhan Haikal Ehsan

During presentation day, we roleplayed as data scientist interns from a fictional consultant company who made a loan prediction automation model for a fictional bank based in India.
